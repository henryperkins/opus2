# Performance and Stability Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

Based on the comprehensive performance analysis, we've implemented the following critical fixes:

### 1. üîß ChatSession.is_active Validation Error Fix

**Problem**: SQLAlchemy model `ChatSession.is_active` had `server_default=text("TRUE")` but `nullable=False` without a Python default. This caused validation errors when the instance was returned before being refreshed, as the field would be `None` despite the database having a default value.

**Root Cause**:
- `ChatService.create_session()` was committing the session but not refreshing it
- Pydantic `ChatSessionResponse` enforced `bool` type but received `None`
- SWR retried rapidly, causing 500 error storms

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# In backend/app/services/chat_service.py
session = ChatSession(
    project_id=project_id,
    title=title or f"Chat {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}",
    is_active=True,  # ‚úÖ Explicit Python default
)
self.db.add(session)
self.db.commit()

# ‚úÖ Refresh to populate server defaults
self.db.refresh(session)
```

### 2. üîß Knowledge Search API Route Mismatch Fix

**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/knowledge/search/{project_id}` but backend only had `/api/knowledge/search` without path parameter, causing 404 errors.

**Root Cause**:
- Frontend expected project ID in URL path
- Backend expected project IDs in JSON body
- No backward compatibility route existed

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# In backend/app/routers/knowledge.py
@router.post("/search/{project_id}")
async def search_knowledge_by_project(
    project_id: int,
    request: KnowledgeSearchRequest,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
) -> KnowledgeResponse:
    """Backward compatibility route for /api/knowledge/search/{project_id}"""
    request.project_ids = [project_id]
    return await search_knowledge(request, db)
```

### 3. üîß Enhanced Database Schema Analysis

**Problem**: The `auto_align_db.py` script didn't detect server_default/validation mismatches that could cause runtime errors.

**Enhancement Added**:
```python
def detect_server_default_mismatches(self, table_name: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Detect columns with server defaults that might cause validation issues."""
    # Identifies columns where:
    # 1. ORM has nullable=False but no Python default
    # 2. DB has a server_default
    # 3. This can cause validation errors before refresh
```

**Features**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warns about potential validation issues
- üí° Provides actionable suggestions
- üîç Helps prevent similar issues in future models

## Validation Results

All fixes have been validated:
- ‚úÖ ChatSession explicit `is_active=True` setting
- ‚úÖ Database refresh after commit
- ‚úÖ Backward-compatible knowledge search route
- ‚úÖ Enhanced schema analysis with suggestions

## Impact

These fixes address the root causes of:
- **500 errors** on `/api/chat/sessions` POST requests
- **404 errors** on `/api/knowledge/search/{id}` requests
- **Render-loop explosions** caused by SWR retry storms
- **Main-thread blocking** from rapid error/retry cycles

## Next Steps

For complete resolution of the performance issues, consider implementing:

1. **Frontend Debouncing**: Add 300ms debounce to search queries
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling on expensive endpoints
3. **Query Coalescing**: Combine multiple SWR calls into single endpoints
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Add failure thresholds to prevent retry storms
5. **Monitoring**: Add Long Task monitoring to catch render-loops early

## Files Modified

- `backend/app/services/chat_service.py` - Fixed ChatSession creation
- `backend/app/routers/knowledge.py` - Added backward-compatible route
- `backend/scripts/auto_align_db.py` - Enhanced schema analysis
- `test_fixes.py` - Validation script (can be removed)

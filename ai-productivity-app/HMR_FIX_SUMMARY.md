# HMR Error Fix Implementation

## Problem Analysis
The `chatAPI.getChatSessions is not a function` error was occurring due to Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in Vite destroying and recreating module instances, causing imported references to become stale.

## Root Causes Fixed

### 1. Missing `getChatSessions` Method
**Issue**: Sidebar was calling `chatAPI.getChatSessions()` but the method didn't exist in the API.
**Fix**: Added `getChatSessions` as an alias to `getSessionHistory` for backward compatibility.

### 2. Unstable API Object During HMR
**Issue**: The `chatAPI` object was being recreated on every HMR update, breaking existing references.
**Fix**: Implemented factory pattern with stable singleton instance that survives HMR.

### 3. Missing HMR Handlers
**Issue**: No HMR acceptance handlers to preserve module state across updates.
**Fix**: Added `import.meta.hot.accept()` handlers to both chat API and WebSocket modules.

### 4. Duplicate WebSocket Connections
**Issue**: HMR was causing multiple WebSocket connections to be created.
**Fix**: Added connection guard to prevent duplicate connections during HMR.

## Files Modified

### `/api/chat.js`
- ✅ Added `getChatSessions` method (alias for `getSessionHistory`)
- ✅ Converted to factory pattern with `createChatAPI()`
- ✅ Added stable singleton instance
- ✅ Added HMR handlers with `import.meta.hot.accept()`
- ✅ Added named exports for better tree-shaking
- ✅ Added development debugging

### `/hooks/useWebSocketChannel.js`
- ✅ Added connection guard to prevent duplicate connections
- ✅ Added HMR handlers
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging

### `/components/common/Sidebar.jsx`
- ✅ Added development debugging to track API method availability
- ✅ Enhanced error logging

## API Export Strategy

Now provides multiple import patterns for maximum compatibility:

```javascript
// Default export (recommended)
import chatAPI from '../api/chat';

// Named exports for specific methods
import { getChatSessions, sendMessage } from '../api/chat';

// Mixed imports
import chatAPI, { getChatSessions } from '../api/chat';
```

## HMR Resistance Features

1. **Stable Object Reference**: API object created once, never reassigned
2. **Factory Pattern**: Clean separation between creation and instance
3. **HMR Handlers**: Explicit hot reloading support
4. **Connection Guards**: Prevent duplicate WebSocket connections
5. **Development Debugging**: Track method availability during HMR
6. **Named Exports**: Better tree-shaking and import flexibility

## Testing the Fix

1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console
3. Make changes to trigger HMR
4. Verify console shows:
   - `[Chat API] Available methods: [...]`
   - `[Sidebar] getChatSessions available: function`
   - No "is not a function" errors
   - No duplicate WebSocket connections

## Benefits

- ✅ Eliminates recurring HMR-related errors
- ✅ Prevents WebSocket connection leaks
- ✅ Improves development experience
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Enables better debugging
- ✅ Follows modern ES module best practices

## Future Prevention

1. Always use factory patterns for shared API modules
2. Add HMR handlers to modules with side effects
3. Export both default and named exports for flexibility
4. Guard against duplicate connections in hooks
5. Add development debugging for critical modules
6. Test HMR behavior during development

# Frontend Environment Configuration - Production Example
# Copy this to .env.production for production deployment

# API Configuration
# Leave empty to use relative URLs (recommended for production behind reverse proxy)
# This allows the frontend to automatically use the same host/domain
VITE_API_URL=

# WebSocket Configuration
# Leave empty to use the same host as the frontend (recommended)
# The app will automatically convert http/https to ws/wss
VITE_WS_URL=

# Cookie Configuration
# Should be false (or omitted) for production HTTPS
# INSECURE_COOKIES=false

# Alternative: If you need to explicitly set URLs for production
# Uncomment and modify these lines:
# VITE_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com
# VITE_WS_URL=wss://yourdomain.com

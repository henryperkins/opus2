# Theme Switching Fix

## Problem Identified

The theme switching was not working due to:

1. **Race condition**: Multiple useEffect hooks were trying to apply the theme simultaneously
2. **Redundant theme applications**: The theme was being applied in multiple places causing conflicts
3. **Missing meta tag**: The `theme-color` meta tag was missing from index.html
4. **Synchronization issues**: The Zustand store update and DOM update were not properly synchronized

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated useTheme.jsx

- Added `isInitialMount` ref to prevent redundant initial theme applications
- Simplified the theme synchronization logic to avoid race conditions
- Added check to prevent applying theme if it's already applied to DOM
- Removed redundant useEffect that was applying theme on every render

### 2. Updated index.html

- Added `<meta name="theme-color">` tag
- Updated initialization script to set theme-color on page load

### 3. Created Test Components

- ThemeTest.jsx - Component with debug functionality
- ThemeTestPage.jsx - Full page for testing theme switching

## How to Test

1. Navigate to `/theme-test` in your browser
2. Click "Toggle Theme" button to switch between light and dark modes
3. Click "Check DOM State" to see console output with theme information
4. Verify that:
   - Background colors change immediately
   - Text colors update properly
   - All themed elements switch correctly
   - No flash of unstyled content

## Key Changes Made

### useTheme.jsx
```javascript
// Added initial mount check
const isInitialMount = useRef(true);

// Prevent redundant DOM updates
if (root.classList.contains(newTheme)) {
  console.log('Theme already applied:', newTheme);
  return;
}

// Simplified initialization logic
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isInitialMount.current || !preferences) return;
  isInitialMount.current = false;
  // ... initialization logic
}, [preferences, applyTheme, getSystemTheme, setPreference]);
```

### index.html
```html
<!-- Added theme-color meta tag -->
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">

<!-- Updated script to set theme-color -->
const metaTheme = document.querySelector('meta[name="theme-color"]');
if (metaTheme) {
  metaTheme.content = theme === 'dark' ? '#111827' : '#ffffff';
}
```

## Expected Behavior

- Theme toggles instantly without delay
- No flash of incorrect theme on page load
- Theme persists across page refreshes
- System preference detection works when set to 'auto'
- Mobile browser theme-color updates with theme changes

## Debugging

If theme switching still doesn't work:

1. Open browser console
2. Navigate to `/theme-test`
3. Click "Check DOM State" button
4. Look for any discrepancies between:
   - Hook theme state
   - DOM classes
   - Meta theme-color value
   - Computed styles

## Technical Details

The theme system uses:
- Tailwind CSS class-based dark mode (`darkMode: 'class'`)
- Zustand for persistent storage
- React Context for theme state management
- HTML initialization script to prevent flash
